AFTER SCORE COUNTER AND TODO APP
1) create a new vue project valled like... vue-components-practice 
2) get rid of the hello world component 
3) then make a "Button" component  that accepts 4 props (text, type, className, and disabled) 
4) such that you can create a button by doing <Button className="btn btn-red" text="Home" type="button" />
5)  create 3 other buttons with one of them being disabled (Profile, Subscription, Log in) 

6) then create an Input component that takes 1 prop named "Placeholder" and whatever you type in there will be the placeholder of the input field 
7) Make the placeholder "Search..."

TASK LIST TODO APP:
You can then try to update your TODO app to work like this: https://vuejsexamples.com/task-list-with-vue-js/

2. TODO APP UPDATE
Another project that comes to my mind as something which everybody should do when practicing React.js it a simple Todo App. It can contain one or three cards or boxes, where you will display the planned tasks, in-progress tasks, and the done tasks. If you decide on the one space for all the asks, add there any colors for the particular status of the tasks.

Another useful feature would be a simple popup or modal to add a new task, and the button to delete the tasks if they are not necessary. 

If you don’t have any idea for the design, take a look at the one below, I’d prepared for you.

RESTAURANT MENU PAGE
The next exciting project you could create for your portfolio is a restaurant menu page. To make it a little more advanced, you can divide positions into categories, each with the list, images, and button to select, or pricing.

It'll have a navbar at the top with a few links: Home, Menu, Contact Us
Then it'll have cards components with images of food, and button for add to cart
